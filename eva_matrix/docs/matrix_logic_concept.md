# EVA Matrix: Concept & Pseudocode
# Purpose: Documentation of the mental model and logical flow for the Psych-State Engine.

## Mental Model
The EVA Matrix is not just a database of numbers; it is a **Fluid Dynamical System**. 
Every input signal (hormones, user stimulus) acts as a "force" that pulls the current state (a point in 9D space) toward a new position.

## Pseudocode: Update Cycle
```python
def update_matrix(current_state, neural_inputs, delta_time):
    # 1. Calculate Stimulus Vector
    # Convert hormones (cortisol, adrenaline) into raw emotional forces.
    stimulus_force = calculate_biocognitive_force(neural_inputs)
    
    # 2. Apply Inertia
    # Emotions don't change instantly.
    target_state = current_state + (stimulus_force * momentum_coefficient)
    
    # 3. Validation & Coherence
    # Apply rules from validation/matrix_coherence_rules.yaml
    final_state = apply_coherence_filters(target_state)
    
    # 4. Persistence
    save_to_local_cache(final_state)
    return final_state
```

## Axis Descriptions (Examples)
- **Stress**: Linked to Cortisol/Adrenaline. High stress triggers "Survival Mode" in CIN.
- **Warmth**: Linked to Oxytocin. Influences the "Sentiment" of the final response.
- **Groundedness**: Represents internal stability. High groundedness buffers against rapid stress spikes.
