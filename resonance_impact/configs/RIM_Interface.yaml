name: Resonance Impact (RIM)
role: Calculate the impact of resonance on physiological and cognitive systems.

description: >
  The Resonance Impact module determines how the resonance index (alignment with self) 
  modifies biological responses and cognitive weightings.

position:
  upstream:
    - RI (Resonance Index)
  downstream:
    - PhysioController
    - Receptor

execution_order:
  - Receive Resonance Index
  - Apply impact curve
  - Calculate modification multipliers
  - Return Impact values

inputs:
  resonance_index:
    source: RI
    type: float
    required_fields:
      - score

outputs:
  resonance_impact:
    type: object
    fields:
      - physiological_multiplier
      - cognitive_weight_offset

constraints:
  performance:
    - latency: < 30ms

invariants:
  - physiological_multiplier must be > 0.0
