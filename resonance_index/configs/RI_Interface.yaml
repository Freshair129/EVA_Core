name: Resonance Index (RI)
role: Calculate the resonance index based on current state and history.

description: >
  The Resonance Index module calculates a scalar value representing the degree of 
  alignment or 'resonance' between the current cognitive state and historical patterns.

position:
  upstream:
    - EVA Matrix
    - RMS
  downstream:
    - MSP
    - CIN

execution_order:
  - Receive state vector
  - Query memory for matches
  - Calculate resonance score
  - Return RI value

inputs:
  state_vector:
    source: EVA Matrix
    type: vector
    required_fields:
      - emotions
      - values

outputs:
  resonance_index:
    type: float
    range: [0.0, 1.0]
    fields:
      - score

constraints:
  performance:
    - latency: < 50ms

invariants:
  - score must always be between 0.0 and 1.0
